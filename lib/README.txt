Here in these FLutter Projects we are just learning about the widgets of the FLutter and how they work

First we have Center Widget - Which center the widget(child). it takes the height and width of the parent and centers the widget accordingly

We have an option to manipulate the position of the center widget using heightFactor and widthFactor, it basically takes the height and width of the child and multiplies it with the given herightFactor or widthFactor or both and keeps the widget in the center of the resulting height or width
